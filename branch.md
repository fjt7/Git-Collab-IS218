## What is a branch in Github?

A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch â€” the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.

## Why do we branch?

Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

## Steps for Branching:
1. Creating a new branch.
2. Creating a new file.
3. Stage and commit the new file to the working branch.
4. Merge working branch changes.
